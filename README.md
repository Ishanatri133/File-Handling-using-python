Problem statement 


- find files with exension xlsx with same prefix (abc-xx)

- Make a copy and store in one designated folder

- After collecting each file, read data in one of the tabs with same name

- Tab has 40 rows and 20 Columns

- Each file has columns in the same order and same labels

- Store that data in sql table from each one in one table( add a additional column to recognize where data came from)

- One thing to be careful- there is one column that has lot of text, i want to store all of that text

- Once stored, create a function in vba to retrieve it

- also create a python script to do it
